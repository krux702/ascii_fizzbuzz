# ASCII FizzBuzz

Part of a programming challenge I was given was to write FizzBuzz ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz ) in five
different languages.  And being a fan of the demo scene, this gave me as good of a reason as any to program up an
old school text scroller.

This code requires aalib ( http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib/ ) which is a fairly old ascii art GFX library
which handles the hard work of virtualizing a VGA display and representing it in ASCII.
